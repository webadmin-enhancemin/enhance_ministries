                <h2>How Enhance Started</h2>
                <p>After more than two decades in pastoral ministry, Matt Swigart experienced firsthand the unique challenges pastors face—the isolation, the weight of leadership, and the need for trusted voices who understand the journey.</p>
                <p>Enhance Ministries was born from Matt's conviction that pastors shouldn't have to navigate these challenges alone. What began as informal conversations with fellow pastors grew into a calling to come alongside ministry leaders with coaching, care, and practical support.</p>
                <p>Today, Enhance Ministries serves pastors and churches across the region, helping leaders find health, clarity, and renewed vision for the long haul of ministry.</p>
