            <div class="member-bio-col">
                <p>Matt Swigart is the founder and executive director of Enhance Ministries — a calling shaped by more than two decades of pastoral experience, a deep love for the Church, and a conviction that ministry leaders deserve real, trusted support.</p>
                <h3>Ministry Roots</h3>
                <p>For 12 years, Matt served at New Life Church of Woodbury, MN, where he led as Youth Pastor, Saturday Night Service Lead Pastor, and Elder. His passion for developing leaders grew through leading short-term mission trips to Honduras, Panama, New York City, Houston, and Ukraine, and through coaching youth pastors across the country as part of LEAD222, an international youth pastor coaching organization.</p>

                <h3>Athletics &amp; Coaching</h3>
                <p>Matt's love for athletics runs deep. He has coached his children in baseball and basketball, led high school teams at New Life Academy, and currently serves as the Head Men's and Women's Tennis Coach at the University of Northwestern–St. Paul — where he is the all-time winningest coach in the program's history.</p>

                <h3>Founding Enhance</h3>
                <p>In late 2020, Matt felt the Holy Spirit clearly calling him to launch Enhance Ministries. Recognizing that his first 20 years of ministry had uniquely prepared him for the next chapter, he stepped out in faith to build a platform where healthy leaders lead healthy, fruitful ministries.</p>
                <h3>Family</h3>
                <p>Matt's primary ministry is his family. He has been married to his wife, Christina, since December 2000. Together they have three children: Caitlyn (Ricky), Caleb, and Lucy.</p>
