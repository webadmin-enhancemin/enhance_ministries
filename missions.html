                        <h3>What Does the Ministry Experience Look Like?</h3>
                        <p><strong>"Fully Customizable"</strong> is the key! We connect with each youth pastor individually to carefully craft ministry experiences according to what you want your students to experience. Consider what they're good at, where you want them stretched, and how you want to expose them to reaching the hurting and lost.</p>
                        <p>Do you want more labor/service projects like community gardens and painting houses, or more relational/outreach opportunities like visiting homeless camps and going door to door? Or a mix of both! Your unique ministry plan connects you with our incredible friends and ministry partners across St. Paul and Minneapolis.</p>
                        <p class="highlight-text">Our goals are for ministry efforts to be like a "Turbo Strip" for our partners advancing their mission and the Kingdom, and for your students to see and experience God's transformative work as they step out of their comfort zones!</p>

                        <h3>2026 Theme: "Love Unconditionally!"</h3>
                        <p>We're excited to explore this through morning devotions and evening sessions with inspiring worship and outstanding teaching. We'll focus on how to experience God's love and share it with those around us. The Gospel will be clearly presented and challenges that can be taken back into real life will give every opportunity for students to grow and have their lives transformed.</p>

                        <p>Along with built-in times for you to lead and shepherd your groups (morning devos & evening sharing times), you know that the bulk of effective ministry happens in the gaps. Whether it's meals around a table, van rides to and from ministry sites, or those "Can I talk to you about something" conversations, this trip creates plenty of "gaps" for life-on-life ministry with your students.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely! The word "Family" essentially means this trip is not just for students like our other week is. We hope you'll join our family of families for this week!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How does food work?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Breakfast:</strong> At the church for those staying there; hotel lobby for hotel guests; with host families; or home for locals. <strong>Lunch:</strong> Cooler lunches packed at church and taken to ministry sites. <strong>Dinner:</strong> All eat at church Sunday-Thursday. Friday is free day—families are on their own.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How are food allergies handled?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Our caterers do a wonderful job providing for many food allergies. Note these on registration and we'll follow up to see if we need to provide food (TBD additional cost) or if you'll supplement the menu.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">When will we know our ministry assignments?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Ministry site assignments are completed and sent out at least 14 days in advance. The sooner you register, the easier it is to get your preferred ministry types!</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">What are the camping guidelines?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Only portable fire pits are allowed, and you must bring your own firewood.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How does transportation work?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">While church groups may come together in church or rental vans, most families drive themselves to/from the trip and to/from ministry sites daily. Enhance does not provide transportation.</p>
