                    <p class="story-intro">In the late months of 2020, the Holy Spirit ignited a profound realization in Matt's heart—an understanding that the first two decades of his ministry were a divine preparation for the next 20 years and beyond. Fueled by this revelation, Matt, a seasoned coach, team-builder, and speaker, took a bold step of faith and launched Enhance Ministries as a 501c3 non-profit. Since that pivotal moment, God has been at work using Matt's gifts, to advance the sustainability of pastors.</p>
                    <p>Matt is a highly gifted coach, leader and speaker. With over 20 years of experience, he coached dozens of leaders towards greater effectiveness, deeper clarity, and positive reliance on Jesus. As a passionate believer in changing the world through Kingdom-minded living, Matt brings a unique perspective and practical insights that encourage and challenge leaders to excel for the 'long-haul' of ministry calling, operating fully within their gifting and passions.</p>
